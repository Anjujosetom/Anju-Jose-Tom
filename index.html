as a tensor throughout the implementation thereby ensuring efficient utilization of the structural properties of the
video volume. It also addresses the dynamic background issue
(swaying trees, moving water, waves, etc.) by solving a tensor optimization algorithm of a convex formulation that is convergent
in nature. Moreover, the low-rank property is used to extract
the structured part of the scene while Tensor Total Variation
(TTV) is incorporated to draw out the foreground part of the
emotive surroundings.

special features of tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD)
along with regularizations using l1/2-norm with half thresholding
operation and tensor total variation (TTV) to develop
a noise robust MOD system with improved detection accuracy.
While t-SVD exploits the spatio-temporal correlation of the
video background, l1/2 regularization provides noise robustness
besides removing the sparser but discontinuous dynamic elements
in the spatio-temporal direction. Moreover, TTV enhances the
spatio-temporal continuity and fills up the gaps due to the lingering
objects and thereby extracting the foreground precisely.
The proposed three-way optimization method is designed to
address both static and dynamic background cases of MOD
separately with the intention to reduce the misclassifications
due to moving/cluttered background.

              <p style="text-align:justify"> Automated cleaning systems are less common
in extreme surveillance environments such as traffic surveillance cameras placed at
large heights (contaminants: combustion particles, asphalt deposits),
open pit mining industries (contaminants: quarried, dry
mineral dusts, exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles and other
machinery), hazardous rooms, chambers, shafts, wind tunnels
where the spoliation is extensive and continuous. The surveillance video sequences obtained
from this cameras may be incomplete and entries at the positions
of contaminants may be missing. The accumulations of combustion
fuels, dust, dirt, spider webs, etc., affect the visibility and
clarity of the captured video data to different degrees resulting
in incomplete (missing) video sequences. Grounded on this significant
practical scenario, this work proposes a scheme to concurrently
complete the missing entries and detect moving objects with
efficient background separation by formulating a single convex
optimization problem developed and implemented in the tensor
framework.

              <papertitle> Simultaneous Reconstruction and
Moving Object Detection from Compressive
Sampled Surveillance Videos </papertitle><br>
              <p style="text-align:justify"> The spatially distributed digital cameras in Wireless
Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSN) are provided with
miniature batteries resulting in power constraints. Hence these
cameras acquire compressive measurements of video at a rate
significantly below the Nyquist rate and transmit them wirelessly
in the network. Thus, the encoding side (transmitter) is made
less complex at the expense of increased complexity at the
more resourceful decoder (receiver). Well grounded on the this
relevant practical scenario, a unified system is proposed that
integrates detection of moving objects into the CS recovery
framework and thereby realizing simultaneous data recovery and
object detection in a single convex optimization problem which
guarantees fast response. To accomplish this, the concepts of
multi-linear tensor algebra are manipulated to implement low
rank approximation on the highly correlated background components.
A Laplace function based surrogate for Tensor Nuclear
Norm (TNN) is formulated to provide adaptive thresholding for
the singular value tubes of the background tensor. Moreover,
the spatio-temporal continuity of the foreground is explored
using 3D-Piecewise Smoothness Constraints combinations based
Anisotropic Total Variation (3D-PSCATV) regularization along
with l1 regularization. The proposed model is solved using
Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme.
The quantitative and qualitative results validate the superior
performance of the proposed method against the compared
approaches.

              <papertitle> Video Super Resolution and Joint Moving Object
Detection from Low-Res Surveillance Videos </papertitle><br>
              <p style="text-align:justify"> Video surveillance has become a significant method to preserve public security specifically for the forensic field where high
resolution videos are vital. However, the security video footage captured is found to be low in clarity and deteriorated with noise, blurs
and uneven illumination which can cause false detections and wrong interpretations. In light of this relevant fact, this work proposes a
novel technique which does video super resolution with simultaneous detection of the moving objects using a tensor based convex
optimization problem without the necessity of a reliable training data. The ideas of multilinear algebra are utilized in the super resolution
framework to implement re-weighted tensor nuclear norm minimization for separating the highly correlated scene background. The
spatio-temporal continuity featured by the sparse foreground components is grabbed by the Tensor Total Variation (TTV) regularization
to achieve precise object detection along with l1 regularization. The brilliance of the proposed approach is confined in the efficient
formulation and implementation of video super resolution and simultaneous moving object detection from the available deteriorated
videos. This is solved using the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) with alternating direction scheme and the results validate the
superior performance of the proposed method against the compared approaches.

              <p style="text-align:justify"> In this work, we propose a new moving object
detection method from noisy video data. In general, background of videos are assumed to lie in
a low-rank subspace and moving objects are assumed to be piecewise smooth in the spatial and temporal
direction. The proposed method consolidates the basic mathematics involving nuclear norm, l2-norm, l1-norm and Total Variation
(TV) regularization in a unified framework to obtain simultaneous denoising and MOD performance.
The nuclear norm exploits the low-rank property of the background, the sparsity is enhanced by the l1-
norm, TV regularization is used to explore the foreground spatial smoothness and noise is detected and
removed by the l2-norm regularization.

cases yet to be resolved in Moving Object Detection (MOD), a new formulation is done to detect moving

The objective is to experimentally
prove the possibilities of regularizing nuclear norm, l1-
norm and TV-norm in unified scheme.
While the nuclear norm exploits the low-rank property of background, the sparsity is enhanced
by the l1-norm and the foreground spatial smoothness is explored by TV regularization.
